Welcome to Thomas' Soccer Sim!

There are 5 teams in the game:
Team 1
Team 2
Team 3
Team 4
User Team

You control the User Team.
When you start the game, all of the games between the 
other teams will be simulated and the results are printed.
After this, your team will play the other teams (3 games
in total) to complete the season.

After the other teams play each other, a menu will
appear with 5 options:

0: Continue -> this will start your games

1: View League Standings -> this will show you how 
                            many points each team has

2: View Top Scorers -> this will show you the players
                       who have scored

3: View Top Assisters -> this will show you the players 
                         who have gotten an assist

4: View Passing Stats -> this will show you how many
                         passes each team has made

When you hit Continue, the game will prompt you to choose
your team for your game. To choose a player, enter the 
number to the left of the players name and hit enter.
The format will be:
<number> <name> <role> <rating>

At the end of the season (after you have played all four games),
if you have the most number of points, you will have won the 
league.
